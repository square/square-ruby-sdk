      # Note: You will need to host a valid domain verification file on your domain to support Apple Pay.  The
      # current version of this file is always available at https://app.squareup.com/digital-wallets/apple-pay/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association,
      # and should be hosted at `.well_known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` on your
      # domain.  This file is subject to change; we strongly recommend checking for updates regularly and avoiding
      # long-lived caches that might not keep in sync with the correct file version.
