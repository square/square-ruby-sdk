module SquareApiClient
# Represents a discount being returned that applies to one or more return line
#  items in an
#  order.
#  Fixed-amount, order-scoped discounts are distributed across all non-zero return
#  line item totals.
#  The amount distributed to each return line item is relative to that itemâ€™s
#  contribution to the
#  order subtotal.
  class OrderReturnDiscount
  # @return [String] A unique ID that identifies the returned discount only within this order.
    attr_reader :uid
  # @return [String] The discount `uid` from the order that contains the original application of this
#  discount.
    attr_reader :source_discount_uid
  # @return [String] The catalog object ID referencing [CatalogDiscount](entity:CatalogDiscount).
    attr_reader :catalog_object_id
  # @return [Long] The version of the catalog object that this discount references.
    attr_reader :catalog_version
  # @return [String] The discount's name.
    attr_reader :name
  # @return [SquareApiClient::OrderLineItemDiscountType] The type of the discount. If it is created by the API, it is `FIXED_PERCENTAGE`
#  or `FIXED_AMOUNT`.
#  Discounts that do not reference a catalog object ID must have a type of
#  `FIXED_PERCENTAGE` or `FIXED_AMOUNT`.
#  See [OrderLineItemDiscountType](#type-orderlineitemdiscounttype) for possible
#  values
    attr_reader :type
  # @return [String] The percentage of the tax, as a string representation of a decimal number.
#  A value of `"7.25"` corresponds to a percentage of 7.25%.
#  `percentage` is not set for amount-based discounts.
    attr_reader :percentage
  # @return [SquareApiClient::Money] The total declared monetary amount of the discount.
#  `amount_money` is not set for percentage-based discounts.
    attr_reader :amount_money
  # @return [SquareApiClient::Money] The amount of discount actually applied to this line item. When an amount-based
#  discount is at the order level, this value is different from `amount_money`
#  because the discount
#  is distributed across the line items.
    attr_reader :applied_money
  # @return [SquareApiClient::OrderLineItemDiscountScope] Indicates the level at which the `OrderReturnDiscount` applies. For `ORDER`
#  scoped
#  discounts, the server generates references in `applied_discounts` on all
#  `OrderReturnLineItem`s. For `LINE_ITEM` scoped discounts, the discount is only
#  applied to
#  `OrderReturnLineItem`s with references in their `applied_discounts` field.
#  See [OrderLineItemDiscountScope](#type-orderlineitemdiscountscope) for possible
#  values
    attr_reader :scope
