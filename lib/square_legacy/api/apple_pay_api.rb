  # ApplePayApi
  class ApplePayApi < BaseApi
    # Activates a domain for use with Apple Pay on the Web and Square. A
    # validation
    # is performed on this domain by Apple to ensure that it is properly set up
    # as
    # an Apple Pay enabled domain.
    # This endpoint provides an easy way for platform developers to bulk
    # activate
    # Apple Pay on the Web with Square for merchants using their platform.
    # Note: You will need to host a valid domain verification file on your
    # domain to support Apple Pay.  The
    # current version of this file is always available at
    # https://app.squareup.com/digital-wallets/apple-pay/apple-developer-merchan
    # tid-domain-association,
    # and should be hosted at
    # `.well_known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` on your
    # domain.  This file is subject to change; we strongly recommend checking
    # for updates regularly and avoiding
    # long-lived caches that might not keep in sync with the correct file
    # version.
    # To learn more about the Web Payments SDK and how to add Apple Pay, see
