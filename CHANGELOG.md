## SDKs

- **All Square SDKs:**

  By default, all SDKs send requests to Square's production (https://connect.squareup.com) or sandbox (https://connect.squareupsandbox.com) hosts based on the client's `environment` parameter.

  You now have the option to use a custom URL instead. To use a custom URL, follow the example for your language to set the `environment` parameter to `custom` and the `customUrl` parameter to your URL:

  - Java

    ```java
    new SquareClient.Builder()
      .environment(Environment.CUSTOM)
      .customUrl("https://example.com")
    ```

  - .NET

    ```csharp
    new Square.SquareClient.Builder()
      .Environment(Environment.Custom)
      .CustomUrl("https://example.com")
    ```

  - Node.js

    ```javascript
    new Client({
      environment: Environment.Custom,
      customUrl: "https://example.com",
    });
    ```

  - PHP

    ```php
    new Square\SquareClient([
      'environment' => Environment::CUSTOM,
      'customUrl' => 'https://example.com',
    ]);
    ```

  - Python

    ```python
    Client(
      environment = 'custom',
      custom_url = 'https://example.com',)
    ```

  - Ruby

    ```ruby
    SquareLegacy::Client.new(
      environment: 'custom',
      custom_url: 'https://example.com'
    });
    ```

- **Square .NET SDK:**

  Square has overridden the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods for models:

  - In the `Equals` override, Square has implemented a field-level comparison.
  - The Square `GetHashCode` override now ensures that hashes are deterministic and unique for each object.

- **Square Node.js SDK:**

  Endpoints that return 64-bit integers now return a `BigInt` object instead of a `Number` object.

- **Connect Node.js SDK:** (deprecated)

  The deprecated Connect Node.js SDK is in the security [maintenance state.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/api-lifecycle#maintenance) It does not receive any bug fixes or API updates from the Square version 2021-02-26 release. However, the SDK will receive support and security patches until it is retired (end of life) in the second quarter of 2021. For more information, including steps for migrating to the [Square Node.js SDK,](https://github.com/square/square-nodejs-sdk) see the [Connect SDK README.](https://github.com/square/connect-nodejs-sdk/blob/master/README.md)

  - `InvoicePaymentRequest.automatic_payment_source` specifies the payment method for an automatic payment.

  As part of this change, the [InvoiceDeliveryMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceDeliveryMethod) and [InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource) enums are added and the `InvoiceRequestMethod` enum is deprecated.

  The Invoices API will continue to accept `request_method` in create and update requests until the field is retired, but starting in this version, `request_method` is not included in returned `Invoice` objects. For more information, see the [migration notes.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#migrate-InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method)

## Existing API updates

All SDKs have been updated to support the following changes:

- **Catalog API**

  - Batch upsert catalog objects endpoint &mdash; The `batches` field is now required and the array must have at least one element.
  - CatalogModifier &mdash; Two fields added:
    - `ordinal` to support custom ordering in a modifier list
    - `modifier_list_id` to reference the parent modifier list
  - CatalogModifierList &mdash; New field added: `ordinal` to support custom ordering in a list of **CatalogModifierList** objects.

- **Customers API changes**

- **Orders API changes**

  - CreateOrderRequest &mdash; Previously these request fields were deprecated: `line_items`, `taxes`, `discounts`. These fields are no longer available. Instead you now use the `Order` object in the request. For example, `Order.line_items`, `Order.taxes`, and `Order.discounts`.
  - OrderLineItem type &mdash; There are two changes:
    - The `taxes` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_taxes` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemTax.scope` field.
    - The `discounts` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_discounts` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemDiscount.scope` field.

- **Shared object updates**
  - **Card object** &mdash; New fields added: `card_type`, `prepaid_type`. Currently, only the Payments API responses populate these fields.
